        About me I am an electronics and telecommunications engineer graduated
        from the University of Cauca in Colombia, with 23 years of experience in
        pre-sales and sales areas. During the pandemic I wanted to take
        advantage of my free time and began to learn about the technologies on
        which the WWW is built today: for a year I learned the fundamentals of
        HTML, CSS and Javascript. Then I started learning node.js and consuming
        APIs with JS and exploring some tools like Prisma.io (ORM), Vite
        (Frontend Tooling) and TailwindCSS. I am currently learning about the
        Azure stack for the development of applications in the cloud and
        databases such as MongoDb and PostgreSQL for data storage required in
        the development of full-stack applications. My medium-term goal is to be
        able to develop full-stack applications for the Internet of Things (IoT)
        leveraging Azure IoT and Arduino. Projects I've defined my own learning
        path based mainly in the FreeCodeCamp curriculum including the free
        challenges of FrontendMentor.io that you can try to improve your skills
        in the foundation of web development: HTML, CSS and Javascript. You will
        see my projects or challenges solved in each phase below and any comment
        or sugestion is welcomed. Stack Resources These are articles and useful
        resources that I compiled in my learning process as a fullstack
        developer. Contact
