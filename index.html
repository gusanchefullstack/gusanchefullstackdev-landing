    Gustavo Sanchez Fullstack Developer About me Projects Blog Stack Resources
    Contact About me I am an electronics and telecommunications engineer
    graduated from the University of Cauca in Colombia, with 23 years of
    experience in pre-sales and sales areas. During the pandemic I wanted to
    take advantage of my free time and began to learn about the technologies on
    which the WWW is built today: for a year I learned the fundamentals of HTML,
    CSS and Javascript. Then I started learning node.js and consuming APIs with
    JS and exploring some tools like Prisma.io (ORM), Vite (Frontend Tooling)
    and TailwindCSS. I am currently learning about the Azure stack for the
    development of applications in the cloud and databases such as MongoDb and
    PostgreSQL for data storage required in the development of full-stack
    applications. My medium-term goal is to be able to develop full-stack
    applications for the Internet of Things (IoT) leveraging Azure IoT and
    Arduino. Projects I've defined my own learning path based mainly in the
    FreeCodeCamp curriculum including the free challenges of FrontendMentor.io
    that you can try to improve your skills in the foundation of web
    development: HTML, CSS and Javascript. You will see my projects or
    challenges solved in each phase below and any comment or sugestion is
    welcomed. Stack Resources These are articles and useful resources that I
    compiled in my learning process as a fullstack developer. Contact
